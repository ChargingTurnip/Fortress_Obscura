			// folder.
			// Note that this folder is scanned only when the game is booted.

			// or customizations intentially installed by the user.
			//
			// This directory is searched LAST.  If you visit a server and download
			// a custom model, etc, we don't want that file to override the default
			// game file indefinitely (after you have left the server).  Servers CAN have
			// custom content that overrides the default game files, it just needs to be
			// packed up in the .bsp file so that it will be mounted as a map search pack.
			// The map search pack is mounted at the top of the search path list,
			// but only while you are connected that server and on that map.
